Ways of finding count for given word:
1) Pass a String to a predicate that tests if it is == to "the".
2) In the filter code every time it passes, increment a counter.
Another method:
For each individual word (2106) in our TreeSet, go over to awmt.txt and test every word to see if it equal.
We can use our filter code to do this. Every time we see a match, we increment the counter.

How much work is this:
2106 words and for each word we need to compare it with ~ 8200 word. 17 million compares.

If we use a TreeMap we only need to do ~ 8200 operations.
